It captures detailed facial expressions.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnabgho/MPM-GAN/master/images/G2_DifferentNoiseMessageConditioned.png\" width=\"300px\" height=\"50px\"/>\r\n\r\nGenerations of Generator 2 with N(0,1) noise distribution with conditioned message passing. It captures smooth features of facial expression.\r\n\r\nArtistic Creation\r\n---\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnabgho/MPM-GAN/master/images/conceding_message_conditioned_msgimages_G1_artistic_.png\" width=\"300px\" height=\"50px\"/>\r\n\r\nGenerations look as if showing the process of artist creation. The generations were created using a message interpolation by keeping the noise constant and varying the message between the 2 messages. It shows that the message space is also continuous.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Best Performing Model\r\n---\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnabgho/MPM-GAN/master/images/Conditioned-Message.png\" width=\"600px\" height=\"375px\"/>\r\n\r\nSalient Features\r\n\r\n* A common Message Generator looks at the input to the generators and their respective outputs and generates a message to be passed to the other generator.\r\n\r\n* Each Generator generates images conditioned on (noise, message received from the analysis of the other generator).\r\n\r\nResults and Analysis\r\n---\r\n\r\nClassification Results\r\n---\r\n\r\n* The images were passed through the discriminator and the message generator to get the representation from the activations of the hidden layers as was used by DCGAN Radford et al. (2015).\r\n\r\n| Model | Discriminator Rep | Message Rep   | Msg+Disc Rep |  \r\n| ------| ----------------- |:-------------:| ------------:|\r\n| DCGAN Radford et al. (2015) | 22.48% | NA | NA |\r\n| Improved GANs Salimans et al. (2016) |8.11 ± 1.3 %  | NA | NA |\r\n| Different Noise MP | 20.1% | 53.48% | 18.7% |\r\n| Different Noise CMP| 17.1% | 54.21% | 15.2% |\r\n| Conceding CMP      | 18.37% | 64.46% | 17.4% |\r\n| Competing CMP      | 17.76% | 52.05% | 16.8% |\r\n| Competing Objective | 18.02% | NA | NA |\r\n| Conceding Objective | 17.56% | NA | NA |\r\n\r\n\r\n* As shown in the Table all of the models’ discriminator representation improved the results over the discriminator representation of DCGAN Radford et al. (2015) thus showing that the proposed models provide regularization to the training procedure of the discriminator. \r\n\r\n* The non-trivial accuracy obtained by the message representation which never got to see the real images is an interesting phenomena while the improvement of the accuracy with the Message along- side the Discriminator features shows that the Message representation learns some complementary features which helps in the overall classification task.\r\n\r\nMessage Clustering\r\n---\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnabgho/MPM-GAN/master/images/Cluster_Analysis.png\" width=\"450px\" height=\"450px\"/>\r\n\r\n* The celebrity dataset Liu et al. (2015) was used to partition the faces based on the type of hair into five categories: bald, black, brown, blond and gray.\r\n\r\n* The images belonging to these partitions were passed through the Message Generator to get the representations of each of the images from the Message Generator.\r\n\r\n* The representations are then reduced to 2 dimensions using T-SNE and then they are represented using the different colors.\r\n\r\n* The messages for the bald hair style totally separates from the rest while black and brown being a bit subjective are similar in the message space but some clusters for black hair emerge which are totally pure.\r\n\r\n* Gray hair also separates quite clearly from the rest.\r\n\r\nSome Interesting Interpolation Results\r\n----\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnabgho/MPM-GAN/master/images/conceding_message_conditioned_msgimages_G1_.png\" width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\"/>\r\n\r\nThis is a perfect rendering of the creation that an artist takes in order to create a masterpiece applying changes one layer at a time\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnabgho/MPM-GAN/master/images/competingimages_G2_.png\" width=\"450px\" height=\"450px\"/>\r\n\r\nThe generations move from a cartoon-like representation of the woman to the actual face of the woman.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnabgho/MPM-GAN/master/images/competing_message_conditionedimages_G1_1_.png\" width=\"450px\" height=\"450px\"/>\r\n\r\nThe generations move from a human to angel/spirit like representation\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnabgho/MPM-GAN/master/images/conceding_message_conditioned_msgimages_G2_.png\" width=\"450px\" height=\"450px\"/>\r\n\r\nThe classic example of depiction of ageing process.
